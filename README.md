# BiliBIli Community Suite

Unfortunately, BiliBili deprecated some of the old APIs that are relavent to this project, and the new one became much more complex to use (they added some encryption). In other words, This project no long works, except for the bag-of-words model. Additionally, the project was written two years ago when I was a beginner, so I will reimplement everything with async libraries when I have time.
