# BiliBili-Community-Suite

import bilisuite as bls

Module dependency: **pandas, sklearn, requests, jieba, bs4, re**

The main file is bilisuite.py, while the others are the applications. You can also build your own tools based on bilisuite.py, and methods are pretty straight forward. I developped all these using google chrome, and I suggest you stick with it too in case weird problems occured. Also, the website changes as well, so the program might fail at any time. (espeically the bls.load.data, which allows user get video data, because BiliBili is about to change vidoe data information in the near future) The followings are some tools I provide.

1. Protecter (see protecter.py & stopword.txt)
2. Tracer (see example.py)
3. Observer (see example.py)
4. Spammer (see example.py)
